Another Iteration of my personal website.
Where are the first 2? - Not gonna say, cause they're embarassing.

Pay no attention to the structure of my css - because I didn't either.


- Made with "Create-React-App"
- Hosted on Heroku using this build-pack [https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) instead of having to wrap the whole thing in an Expressjs server (thanks bro)
